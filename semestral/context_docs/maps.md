tricks,
and more.

Cliff is one of the oldest and most common battlefields in World of Tanks, available for Tier IV to X battles. The
Summer map is almost mirrored on a horizontal axis cutting through the prominent lighthouse. It is very open with many
hills, bushes, and trees. A perfect battleground for dynamic vehicles with good elevation angles, but everyone can claim
victory with the right tactic.

Check the map above to see the most favorable positions for every class and points of interest to gain the upper hand.

Dive right into the action: Both teams start on equal footing, and popular strategies apply to either starting position.
Early encounters and brawls for the best positions are unavoidable.
Control the middle, control the match: Quickly gaining control of the center of the map will put high pressure on
opponents, forcing them to adapt their tactics.
Know the battleground: Key positions are the “Doughnut area” (E3/4 and F3/4), the middle of the map (E5/6 and F5/6), and
the hill with the lighthouse (E8 and F8).
Hot spots: D3 position for the team starting in the north (row A) and G2 position for the team starting in the south (
row K) are to provide support during early battle development and late game.

### Class Strategies

#### Lights

Try to quickly gain higher ground, preferably around the lighthouse (F8 on the minimap) at the end of the drawn-in path.
Fast vehicles should spot the enemy team, provide vital intel, and fire support from the X positions (D3 red and G2
green).

#### Medium

Well-armored vehicles should advance toward the middle at the foot of the lighthouse hill (E5/6 and F5/6).
Fast ones can try to flank the enemy via the back route around the lighthouse hill (column 9 on the minimap) if your
team holds the lighthouse position (F8).

#### Heavy

Slow and sturdy vehicles should follow the western route (along columns 1 and 2 on the minimap) toward the enemy base.
The path along the cliffs provides cover and allows for entrenched brawls.
Agile vehicles with high firepower and low armor should provide support for medium tank advances in the middle (along
columns 5 and 6 on the minimap).

#### Tank Destroyer (TD)

Slower vehicles should cover their home base and provide long-range fire support from the positions marked with X (rows
B and J on the minimap).
Excellent sniper positions are located around A5 and K5 at the end of the drawn-in path.

#### SPG (Artillery)

Only a limited number of favorable positions close to the team bases.
Fall back to the corners of the map at A1 and K1 to provide support for heavy tanks advancing along the cliffs (columns
1 and 2 on the minimap) and the “Doughnut” area in the middle (E3/4 and F3/4).
Take position at A4 and K3 to provide support for allies in the center of the map (rows E and F from columns 3 to 6 on
the minimap).

## Map Tactic Guide: El Halluf

A spacious valley sprinkled with boulders and trees lies in the center of the map. High mountain ridges flanking the
valley provide natural sniper positions. Capturing bases becomes a real feat, as both team bases are situated in easily
defended hilly regions.

Commanders!

Watch the Map Tactic Guide video and read all about the El Halluf map to discover useful tips and tricks for every
vehicle
class, insider strategies, and more.

El Halluf is an exciting 1,000x1,000 m desert landscape for Tier IV to X vehicles, characterized by steep ridges, a deep
valley with bushes, trees, and a village, and narrow alleys for close-quarters combat. Brawlers with plenty of HP and
armor will have a blast duking it out in the northwest corner. Those blessed with accuracy and camouflage can easily
hide between the steep rock formations to rain down fire from above. Nimble scouts, meanwhile, will feel right at home
in the center of the map among the foliage and destructible buildings.

Everyone is guaranteed to find their niche on El Halluf, no matter what type of vehicle or class. But it's those who
have mastered the art of hull-down and sidescraping who will dominate this unique battlefield.

Check out the map above to see the most favorable positions for every vehicle class, as well as helpful points of
interest for gaining the upper hand.

Put heavies in the corner: The northwest corner of El Halluf offers key brawling positions for heavy tanks and narrow
pathways for rugged medium tanks and tank destroyers with solid turrets.
Keep your hull down: The hilly desert terrain offers plenty of opportunities to put hull-down tactics and excellent gun
depression to the test.
Hunt as a pack: The unique map layout offers excellent positions for lone wolves, but be aware of snipers hiding along
the ridgeline. Having a buddy by your side for moral and fire support is better.
Keep it classy: Brawlers with tough exteriors are the undisputed kings of El Halluf. But everyone has the potential for
greatness if they play to their strengths: snipers should snipe, scouts should scout, and supporters should support.
It ain’t over till the last shot: Keep an eye on the minimap and the battle progress. Advance with your team to pile on
the pressure, or fall back for one last stand from behind the base.

### Class Strategies

#### Lights

Quickly make your way to the center of the map. The valley offers excellent scouting positions and plenty of cover.

The area around the D4 rock allows you to watch out for enemies advancing to the key northwest corner.

The destructible village at F6 offers cover for scouting snipers hiding along the ridgeline and lighting up enemies
trying to flank from the south.

Bushes and shrubs along the pathway in the center allow for easy relocation and active scouting.

#### Medium

Fast medium tanks with a punch and solid armor should immediately head to A1 in the northwest to hold off enemies until
the brawlers arrive.

An alternative route at the start is rushing into the valley at G7 to cut off flanking enemies and spot snipers taking
position in the hills.

#### Heavy

The path for heavy tanks on El Halluf might be limited to the area around A1/B2, but it's an impactful one nonetheless.
The northwest corner of the map is the key to breaking through and taking the enemy base.

Use hull-down tactics and sidescraping to effectively brawl between the rock formations and stop enemy advancements.

#### Tank Destroyer (TD)

Tank destroyers blessed with armor and powerful guns should act as second-line supporters around A3 and C1.

Nimble TDs with high accuracy and camouflage will find plenty of sniper positions along the entire ridge line above the
valley and around G9 and H6.

#### SPG (Artillery)

SPG (Artillery) commanders don’t have to roll far to find good initial positions. Get comfortable in the area behind the
base and
offer support to the northwest corner or the middle.

Keep an eye on the battle progress and relocate along the J and 0 lines if the enemy team breaks through.

## Map Tactic Guide: Ensk

A mixture of city blocks and wooded outskirts, bisected by railroad tracks. Plan your tactics to take advantage of
defensive choke points, positioning your vehicles to cover the gaps. Artillery is great for deterring enemy
breakthroughs, but remains almost defenseless when exposed to enemy vehicles attacking from cover.

Commanders!

Watch the Map Tactic Guide video and read on to learn useful tips and strategies for every vehicle class, get insider
tricks,
and more.

Ensk is a Summer map available for Tier IV–X battles. The rails on the 6 line divide the battlefield into two zones: The
western part with the streets of Ensk, where battles take place around tight corners, and the eastern section with an
open, hilly area commonly referred to as "the green." Find out which vehicles and tactics excel in each location and
learn why the most direct route isn't always the best.

Check the map above to see the most favorable positions for every class and points of interest to gain the upper hand.

Watch the minimap: Rails divide the map vertically and the only direct horizontal routes to the opposite sides cross the
cap circles. Constantly check the minimap, and disengage from combat if the other side of the battlefield collapses.
Beware long alleys: The rail cars provide quick north and south routes, but long stretches do not have escape routes and
can become deathtraps.
Know the battleground: Enemies can hide behind rail cars, but remember: You can shoot them between the wheelsets and
cause damage.
Proceed with Caution: Enemies might try and flank from the western street (A1 through J1), so if you don't have any
tanks covering it from B1 or J1 positions respectively, advancing without checking that street is a dangerous—possibly
fatal—endeavor.

### Class Strategies

#### Lights

Head over to the northeast (C9) or southeast (H9) areas for spotting and sniping.
Light tanks with strong turrets have an added advantage of hulldown sniping in the east area.

#### Medium

Use buildings (C1 or H1) for cover and keep an eye on activity on the 1 line.
Support your teammates by using the house (D0) for cover or the hills (G0-H0) for hulldown positions.

#### Heavy

Head to the enclosed parts of the city (E2–F2), where fighting breaks out quickly.
City battles are all about alpha damage, side scraping, and hitting enemy weak spots.

#### Tank Destroyer (TD)

If you spawn from the north, windows (D4 and D5) provide sweet hulldown positions and sniping angles.
If you spawn from the south, take a direct route parallel to the rail cars (6 line): You can spot and shoot enemies
crossing—but only if your vehicle has exceptional camouflage values or you possess good sidescraping skills.

#### SPG (Artillery)

Have a look where the majority of your team is headed at the start of the battle game.
Play somewhere around the A or K lines (depending on where you spawn).

## Map Tactic Guide: Himmelsdorf

A labyrinth of streets and squares, impassable for artillery and tank destroyers yet ideal for speedy breakthrough and
bypass by medium and light tanks. Access roads running by the hill, with the castle that dominates the area, and along
the railway lines can help you out of the impasse.

Commanders!

Watch the Map Tactic Guide video and read on to learn useful tips and strategies for every vehicle class, get insider
tricks,
and more.

Himmelsdorf—the village in the sky, as it translates to from German—is one of the oldest battlegrounds in World of
Tanks. The summer map has seen millions of Tier V–X battles and remains a favorite among close-combat enthusiasts and
long-range snipers alike. Fight for dominance of the mighty castle, brawl in its shadows, or take precise shots along
the rail tracks. It might be a very small battlefield, but it has great potential for epic clashes.

Check the map above to see the most favorable positions for every class, as well as points of interest to gain the upper
hand.

Look out for trouble: Speedy light tanks should actively scout the battlefield and provide vital intel for their allies,
especially in the western half of the map.
Storm the castle: Fast medium tanks can try to conquer the hill to establish the eastern flank. But beware, as you never
know who’s coming up the other side.
A banana split with whipped cream: The foot of the castle hill around squares E7 and F7, also known as "The Banana,"
belongs to those with solid armor, powerful punches, and HP to spare.
Window seats have the best view: The area around the center square offers plenty of advantageous positions for
strong-turreted combatants.
Bullet trains are never late: The train tracks in the western part of the map (Lines 1 and 2) are great for sneaky
assaults, sniper attacks, and surprise advancements.
The map to success: Always keep one eye on the minimap. The small size of the battlefield and its narrow pathways make
it easy to predict enemy movements, allowing you to train pre-aiming.

### Class Strategies

#### Lights

Actively scout the battlefield to provide vital intel. The center of the map consists mainly of narrow streets and tight
corners that allow for quick dashes into cover.

Slow vehicles with high camouflage values can sneak across the train tracks (Lines 1 and 2) to spot enemy maneuvers and
for surprise assaults.

#### Medium

The hill can give your team a definite advantage. Fast and semi-fast vehicles, especially with good gun depression
angles, should band together to take the castle.

Vehicles with rigid turrets and accurate guns can take the window positions around the center square—as long as your
team has control of the hill.

#### Heavy

The narrow streets of Himmelsdorf are made for close encounters. Especially the area below the castle hill (squares E7
and F7), lovingly dubbed “The Banana,” is ideal for brawlers with tough frontal armor.

Vehicles with rigid turrets and accurate guns can take the window positions around the center square—as long as your
team has control of the hill.

#### Tank Destroyer (TD)

Sturdy vehicles should use the intel provided by light tanks to advance across the tracks (Lines 1 and 2) behind enemy
lines.

Sharp shooters with accurate guns can find cover along the tracks and around squares C3 and G3.

#### SPG (Artillery)

Take position in squares A1 or K1 to support allied advancements across the train tracks (Lines 1 and 2), and cover the
area around the castle in the east.

## Map Tactic Guide: Karelia

Two avenues of attack are divided by a swamp. The eastern side is ideal for trench warfare. The western side is well
suited for a hard push. The swamp provides a risky but perhaps unexpected attack route.

Commanders!

Watch the Map Tactic Guide video and read all about the Karelia map to discover useful tips and tricks for every vehicle
class,
insider strategies, and more.

Karelia is one of the oldest summer maps for Tier III–X vehicles. The map, a standard 1,000x1,000 meters, is divided by
a central lane into two major avenues of attack: the high grounds in the northwest and the mountains in the southeast.
The landscape is characterized by swamps, rocks, and cliffs that offer little protection against artillery fire.

The open map provides opportunities for every playstyle. So, choose a fighter, pick a lane, and don’t roll off course,
or you might get stuck in the mud.

Check out the map above to see the most favorable positions for every vehicle class, as well as helpful points of
interest for gaining the upper hand.

Drain the swamp: Sneaky light tanks will find plenty of hiding places in the marshy area in the center. Tracking and
reacting to enemy movement is vital on Karelia, and the swamp offers excellent spotting positions.
The icing on top: The mountain plateau in the southeast (also known as the donut) is key for map control. Use fast
vehicles to gain control early in the game and heavy brawlers to hold the position.
Keep watch in the north: The elevated area northwest of the swamp offers breakthrough possibilities. Medium vehicles and
sturdy tank destroyers should take a position to either stop advancements or start an assault.
Damage from above: Karelia is an open map with little cover against artillery fire. SPG (Artillery)s should take
advantage and
support heavy tanks around the mountain area and medium tanks in the northwest.
Strength in numbers: Whether your team decides to advance through the high grounds or fight for the mountain area, it is
best to stick together, coordinate the assault, and only leave a few team members to secure the opposite flank.

#### Lights

Providing intel for the team and spotting enemy movement should be the primary objectives for light tanks on Karelia.
The swamp areas left and right of the central road (murder road) offer spotting positions into the southeast and
northwest.
Bold light tanks with speed and firepower can also support medium tank advancements in the northwest or keep watch at B4
and D2 while the team pushes the southeast lane.

#### Medium

Always check the lineup and consider your tactics based on the enemy composition. If you can outplay the opposing
mediums, immediately take over the donut position in the southeast.

Alternatively, stay together with your heavy tank and support their advancements through the mountain area.

If your team cannot take the hill, drive to the northwest to secure the corner or start a flanking maneuver.

#### Heavy

Slower heavy tanks should drive to the southeast and trade shots with enemies at the foot of the hill or through the
outside area. Beware of enemy SPGs (Artillery), as the outer lane is more exposed to shells from above than the inner
path.

As a mobile heavy, assist your medium tanks in taking the southeast hill, or support their advances in the northwest if
the enemy lineup is unfavorable.

#### Tank Destroyer (TD)

Speedy tank destroyers can immediately advance to the F0 or K7 positions and use rocks with bushes to dish out
punishment against players contesting the hill.

Slower tank destroyers should stay near their base to assist their team in the fight on the hill. Alternatively, going
to the southeastern corners and supporting the heavy tank advances is an option if you have a lot of armor.

Positioning yourself at A8 or G1 allows TDs to support advancing medium tanks in the northwestern high grounds.

#### SPG (Artillery)

Self-propelled guns should initially locate themselves behind their base. Elevated positions and an open map layout
allow for shots into the heavy tank area in the southeast.

Keep an eye on the minimap and the course of the battle, and relocate if the enemy team breaks through.

## Map Tactic Guide: Mines

A high hill in the center of the map provides a perfect outpost for your attacks. A village to the north-east of the
hill and an island to the west offer a wide range of tactical advantages but lay open to fire from the center.

Commanders!

Watch the Map Tactic Guide video and read on to learn useful tips and strategies for every vehicle class, get insider
tricks,
and more.

Mines is a small summer battlefield available for all tiers. It is divided into three key areas: islands and fordable
water to the west, a flat hilltop in the center, and a village to the east. Dominating the middle with its excellent
firing positions is key, but support from the flanks can turn the battle around.

Check the map above to see the most favorable positions for every class and points of interest to gain the upper hand.

King of the hill, king of the match: The hilltop in the center (around E6) offers fantastic spotting and firing
positions for fast vehicles.
Hang back and let the battle unfold: Snipers and those with less armor should avoid hasty advancements. Let quick allies
spot enemies and take them out from a distance.
Secure the ascend: Heavily armored vehicles should take a position at the foot of the hill to support conquering this
critical area.
Open a second flank: Use the routes through the village (D9 and E9) or via the islands (E1 and H1/H2) to put on
additional pressure.

#### Lights

The hilltop in the center of the map (around E6) is highly important, especially early in the match. Fast light tanks
should immediately try to take the area for their team and spot enemies from higher ground.

Slower light tanks can also advance to the middle to ascend the hill but should have the support of medium or heavy
tanks.

Positions on the island (E1 and H1/H2) are good for spotting but can be overrun by more powerful TDs.

#### Medium

Fast medium tanks should support team advancement in the center. Either take the hill with light tank allies or support
the ascend from pockets at D4 and G4.

Well-armored medium tanks and those with high firepower can open up a second flank through the village in the west (D9
and E9) while their allies have control of the hill area.

#### Heavy

Advance to the area around the foot of the hill (D5 to D7 and G5 to G7). It allows you to spot enemies atop while
brawling with opponents along columns 5 and 7.

If your team doesn’t have control of the hill, support the advancement of slower light and medium tanks and take a
position in the pockets around D4 and G4.

#### Tank Destroyer (TD)

Powerful snipers and tank destroyers with weak armor should stay close to their base (around A4, J7, and K5) to provide
fire support into the middle.

Taking positions on the islands at E1 and H1/H2 allows further supporting the middle, especially during the late game.

#### SPG (Artillery)

Take position in A1 and K9 to provide covering fire for allies fighting for the path up the hill at E5.

## Map Tactic Guide: Outpost

The dense central structures in the middle of the map are the key point for the location. Controlling this area allows
you to hold an all-around defense by firing across the vast fields around the town. Beyond the walls of the
fortifications, you should take advantage of terrain irregularities as most of the area is very exposed to enemy fire.

Commanders!

Watch the Map Tactic Guide video and read on to learn useful tips and strategies for every vehicle class, get insider
tricks,
and more.

Outpost is a summer map with lots of open space, available for Tier V–X battles. It has multiple gameplay zones,
allowing every vehicle type to shine and every tactical approach to be tried out. Each zone has a unique landscape with
special objects so you always know where you are. The main landmark is the castle on a hill, which dominates the center.

Check the map above to see the most favorable positions for every class and points of interest to gain the upper hand.

Think at an angle: Outpost can be roughly divided in half, with a diagonal axis from the top left (A1) to the bottom
right (K0). Important positions are mirrored along this line to give both teams equal footing.
Occupy the high ground: The most prominent feature of Outpost is the hill with its castle in the center of the map (
around E5). In addition to stunning views, it also offers nice vantage points to spot and shoot opponents.
March to the marsh: The swamp area in the southeast offers sniper spots (J6 and F9), as well as bushes. It's a perfect
playground for accurate vehicles and those with good camouflage values to support the team.
It takes a village: Sturdy vehicles that aren’t afraid of a bit of physical contact will find their home in the
northwest (around C2 and B3). Settling for that village life also provides lines of sight toward the hill.
Keep the backdoor open: Vehicles with heavy armament but light armor should take the sniper positions (F2 and B7). This
allows them to support stern allies in the north, take shots towards the middle, and keep the corridor open in case a
tattered commander has to fall back.

#### Lights

Fast vehicles with firepower should advance to the hill (E5) to secure the key position.

Light tanks with good camouflage will find rocks and bushes for spotting in the middle of the swamp.

#### Medium

Use speed and mobility to storm the castle (E5) and take over this integral position.

Advance to the open marsh area (J6 and F9) to provide fire support towards the middle and open the southeastern front.

#### Heavy

Slow vehicles with lots of HP should head to the northern village (C2–B3) for close-combat brawls.

Sturdy turrets and those who want to put their frontal armor to the test should advance to the corridor leading up the
hill (F5–E6).

#### Tank Destroyer (TD)

Secure the sniper position (F2 or B7) to provide fire support into the village and for the hill.

Advance to the open marsh area (J6 or F9) to take advantage of your mobility and gun depression angles.

#### SPG (Artillery)

Dig into the ditch behind your spawn point (K1 and A0) and provide fire support across the map.

Let the battle unfold and, once your team has the upper hand, move closer toward the center for additional lines of
fire.

## Map Tactic Guide: Oyster Bay

The key fighting area on this volcanic island is a winding rock gorge that is suitable for well-armored and assault
vehicles. The airfield on the other flank allows you to quickly move vehicles closer to the enemy base (or back to
defend your base). However, this location is not properly protected, and you should rely on your vehicle mobility there.
The coastal areas are fairly open, providing the perfect positions for ambush tank destroyers and terrain irregularities
for light and medium tank maneuvers.

Commanders!

Watch the Map Tactic Guide video and read all about the Oyster Bay map to discover useful insider strategies, tips and
tricks
for every vehicle class, and more.

Oyster Bay is a brand-new summer map for Tier V–X vehicles. The extra-large battlefield, a whopping 1,300×1,300 meters,
is a beautiful tropical island in the Pacific with sandy beaches, a central airfield, a steep mountain range, and the
titular oyster farms in the southeast. It is an exciting new landscape that offers great opportunities for every class
and playstyle.

Put on your shades, apply a healthy amount of sunscreen, and prepare to fight for victory on this stunning new addition
to Random Battles!

Check out the map above to see the most favorable positions for every vehicle class, as well as helpful points of
interest for gaining the upper hand.

Tracks in the sand: The oyster farms in the southeast and the lagoons in the northwest are perfect for fast vehicles to
get a tan and spot enemies.
Seek shade or get burned: The runway and the river in the middle are relatively open, but you can still find plenty of
bushes and cover surrounding this central hub.
Sitting on the dock of the bay: The dockyard behind the southern spawn point and the beach behind the northern one offer
good spots for SPGs (Artillery) to enjoy the view. These are also the areas to make a last stand if the battle gets too
heated.
Gorge on HP: The steep mountains east of the river offer well-protected alleys for hard-headed brawlers and
side-scrapers.
Like ice in the sunshine: Stake your beach umbrella in one of the many sniper positions around the edge of the island,
provide intel for your team, and watch enemy HP melt away in the sun.

#### Lights

Daredevils and hotshots can sneak along the river or use the bushes and palm trees to the left and right of the runway
for active scouting.
Passive scouts should set up camp around C6 and F3 to keep a watchful eye on both the center and the heavy and medium
tank action in the gorge and the lagoons.

#### Medium

The lagoon in the northeast, with its military fortifications, and the oyster farms in the southeast, with boulders and
rock formations, offer plenty of possibilities for tacticians.
The crossfire positions with rocks and bushes north (B5) and south (E2) of the lagoon allow for dynamic hull-down
gameplay.
Interesting stone formations on either side of the mountain range at F6 and H6 allow for side-scraping tactics, support
for brawlers between the cliffs, and surprise assaults.

#### Heavy

The southeast offers three excellent brawling alleys in the shadows of the mountains:

The upper lane on the side of the airfield provides excellent sightlines into the middle of the battlefield. However, be
cautious of the opening at F6, which can serve as a passage between the center and the alley.
The central alley offers protection against artillery fire and has nice side-scraping opportunities.
The third favorable position for brawlers follows the lane between the mountains and the oyster farms. It is the most
exposed option and should only be considered once enough information about the opponents’ whereabouts has been provided
by spotters.

#### Tank Destroyer (TD)

The area around B5 and E2 provides a variety of positions to control the northwest flank and offer support for the upper
heavy tank alley (F6):
Tank destroyers with high camouflage values and good view range should take advantage of bushes for spotting.
Those with superior gun angles will want to seek more open positions to maximize their shooting capabilities.
Positions in E9 and J5 can prevent medium tanks from flanking through the oyster farm and heavy tanks from breaking
through the mountain range.
Take position at E7 and G5 to take out spotted enemies in the middle of the map and punish careless tankers in the
northwest later in the game.
H1 and A8 are “last stand” or emergency fallback positions.

#### SPG (Artillery)

Nice sunny beaches and shores are located all around the island, offering excellent positions to cover the center and
sides of the map.
Settle at A6 or G1 to provide cover fire for heavy tanks brawling the upper alley between the mountains.
The central brawl alley can only be reached with an excessively high shell arc. You usually find easier targets in the
lagoon and oyster farm areas.
The well-protected positions behind the team bases make it harder to get destroyed, but the tradeoffs are longer shell
travel times and limited areas to fire upon.

## Map Tactic Guide: Prokhorovka

Generally open terrain featuring a large hill and a railway embankment. Scattered trees provide concealment for tank
destroyers. On the offensive, strike against the enemy’s flanks, but don't leave your own flanks unguarded. Artillery
enjoy good fields of fire but are still vulnerable to raids by light tanks.

Commanders!

Watch the Map Tactic Guide video and read all about the Prokhorovka map to discover useful tips and tricks for every
vehicle
class, insider strategies, and more.

Prokhorovka is popular—especially among SPGs (Artillery) players, scouts, and snipers—for its vast open space. The
1,000×1,000-meter
landscape has a summer setting and is available for vehicles from Tier IV through Tier X. Key elements that determine
the course of action are a road in the west that runs north and south, a ridge in the center, a village in the center to
the right of the railway tracks, and an elevated hill area in the southeast. The map is characterized by long stretches
of grass, bushes, and trees, with little protection against artillery fire.

Prokhorovka has plenty of opportunities for every playstyle, but a good view range and high accuracy over long distances
are definite pluses for dominating the battle.

Check out the map above to see the most favorable positions for every vehicle class, as well as helpful points of
interest for gaining the upper hand.

A Classic North vs. South: Prokhorovka is horizontally divided along the central E/F axis marked by the ridgeline and
the village. Both teams will find similar positions in their half, with a slight advantage for the southern team
starting closer to the hill area.
Always Keep One Eye Open: Active and passive scouting is crucial on any battlefield but especially on Prokhorovka. The
road along the 2 line and the railway tracks are flanked by bushes and trees, offering excellent cover.
They’ll Be Coming 'Round the Ridge: The center is a critical area that provides excellent spotting positions and firing
lanes. Light and medium tanks with good view ranges should vie for control here. However, beware of enemy snipers and
artillery on the sidelines.
It Takes a Village: The cluster of houses east of the railway is ideal for spotting enemy advancements along the map's
eastern edge, but remember that all the buildings and covers are destructible.
Running Up the Hills: Besides the elevated position in the middle, there is higher ground in the northeast and southeast
corners that offer excellent sniping positions for both teams but provide little cover from artillery.

#### Lights

At the start of the battle, cautiously advance along the road at the 2 line toward the center, utilizing bushes for
passive spotting.

Use scouting equipment like Coated Optics, Binocular Telescope, or Commander’s Vision System to improve your
capabilities to gather vital intel for your team.

Be cautious of sideline snipers when actively spotting from the central ridge.

Remember that your tank’s survival is paramount in gathering information on enemy movements and rotations.

#### Medium

The open space offers a variety of options for all types of medium tanks. Agile mediums with sturdy turret armor should
engage enemies in the bustling center. Those focused on sniping will feel most comfortable supporting light tanks along
the road. Meanwhile, close-quarters combatants will find a home on the fringes of the map’s western edges.

Stealthy movements and map awareness are crucial if artillery is present.

Long-range snipers with good accuracy should take over and hold positions in squares C1 and H1 to offer fire support
across the map.

Fall back to the northwestern (squares A1–A3) and southwestern (squares K1–K3) corners if your team can no longer
provide sufficient reconnaissance.

#### Heavy

Heavy tank commanders will have the hardest time on Prokhorovka, and their fate depends on the capabilities of their
allies and the presence of SPGs (Artillery) on the other team.

Pushing into the center at the E/F 2/3 squares in a fast heavy tank with high firepower can determine the course of the
battle—as long as the opposing team doesn't have artillery or their SPGs (Artillery) have been taken out.

In an artillery-heavy environment, advancing along the railway tracks or advancing the eastern flank atop the hills are
solid options.

Avoid a push along the 1 and 2 lines in the west as you will likely be spotted and picked off by snipers (unless your
team clears the road for you).

#### Tank Destroyer (TD)

Stealthy tank destroyers will have a blast on Prokhorovka as clandestine observers, swiftly striking from the back and
hiding in bushes. Secure one of many designated sniping spots along the sidelines of the map and pick off your targets
one by one.

Precision and careful aiming are paramount, especially when gunning for light tanks riding atop the middle ridge, but
it's very satisfying when executed successfully.

Consider improving your spotting capabilities to be less reliant on your allies.

Blindly sending a shell or two into well-known spotting positions can yield surprising results and is worth a shot.

#### SPG (Artillery)

SPG (Artillery) commanders should hang back and position themselves along the A and K lines to establish a strong
backbone for the
team.

As the battle progresses, choose to advance with allied forces or seek refuge along the railway tracks.

Adaptability is the key to success on Prokhorovka—even for artillery. Prepare to move and reposition as needed to
maintain maximum impact on the battlefield.

## Map Tactic Guide: Redshire

This map is truly unique. The green fields interspersed with rolling hills offer great opportunities for aggressive
attacks. The river running through the middle of the map is more of a guiding landmark than a real obstacle.

vehicle
class, insider strategies, and more.

Redshire is a very open map, which makes it hard to master and not the most popular battlefield, especially among
beginners. Luckily, we have some useful tips to help you turn the tides of battle and claim victory on this summer map
for Tier V–X vehicles.

Check out the map above to see the most favorable positions for every class and helpful points of interest for gaining
the upper hand.

Open wide: Redshire offers plenty of opportunities for swift vehicles to shine. Roam around and use hills and valleys to
your advantage. Or take cover behind trees and foliage to ambush unsuspecting enemies.
Keys to the castle: The castle area around squares E1 and F1 is an important position that offers good side-scraping
opportunities for sturdy medium and heavy tanks.
In the valley below: The area around the crashed Zeppelin at E9/0 and F9/0 can be used for close-combat brawls by heavy
tanks and hull-down gameplay by mediums.
Stuck in the middle: The hill line at 4 and 5 offers great spots for vehicles with a good view range and gun depression.
Take a position and provide intel for your team, support the castle in the west, or spot advancements in the east
valley.

#### Lights

Use your speed and mobility to your advantage and control the center by diving in and out of cover. Or provide intel
from well-camouflaged positions, such as the tree at E3.
Daredevils with lots of guts and even more speed can go on spotting runs between the central road and the river bank
around D7.

#### Medium

Work with the light tanks on your team. Let them provide vital intel while you position yourself behind to pick off
advancing enemies.
Redshire is a very open map with lots of opportunities for medium tanks to roam around and prepare ambushes.
Alternatively, use your mobility and gun depression to take over hull-down positions and support the heavy line in the
valley around the Zeppelin.

#### Heavy

The two major flanks to control are the area around the crashed Zeppelin (E9/0 and F9/0) and the castle (E1 and F1).
Position yourself in areas where you can block enemy advances, but watch out for crossfire from the middle.
Your thick armor and strong turrets are an advantage in close-combat brawls on either side of the map, but the middle
should be mostly avoided.

#### Tank Destroyer (TD)

The hills at C4/5 or G4/5 offer good places to set up and take shots from a distance.
Use your gun depression to your advantage by finding elevated positions where you can shoot at enemies who will have a
hard time retaliating.
Keep an eye on the minimap and fall back if one of the heavy flanks collapses. Redshire offers potent fallback positions
behind the bases, enabling both teams to make a valiant last stand and snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.

#### SPG (Artillery)

The A and K lines offer plenty of positions for shooting into the middle.
Provide fire support for your team into the castle (from A2 or K2) or the Zeppelin area (from A8 or K8).
