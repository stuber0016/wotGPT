## How to Be a Better WoT Player

**Target Audience** – Beginners and advanced players – skill curve of players.  
[https://prnt.sc/10aijfk](https://prnt.sc/10aijfk)

### Basics

Which tech tree to choose, don’t rush to higher tiers, equipment, crew (a separate video will cover Crew 2.0 when it’s
released).  
Grind – How XP is calculated (spotting for yourself/others, tracking, sniping).  
Proper game settings – **SENSITIVITY**  
Watch the minimap, learn to navigate it – enlarge it using the `+` and `-` keys next to Backspace.  
Learn the strengths and weaknesses of your tank and others (analyze them tier by tier.

If someone destroys you, check why – use the site [tanks.gg](https://tanks.gg).  
Know approximate alpha damage and reload times of tanks you encounter – learn to trade damage effectively. Don’t be
afraid to take a hit.  
Learn sidescraping and bush mechanics – spotting and camo mechanics.

### Economy

The principle is simple – **you either sacrifice time or money.**  
**UTILIZE EVENTS!**  
If you can afford it and play often, invest in a premium account.  
If you play F2P, make use of marathons, events, and other offers. At least one Tier 8 premium tank is essential.  
If you don’t have time for marathons or money, use the recruitment system – create a new account, invite it, and
complete missions on it to earn a T8 premium tank.  
If you don’t want to recruit or want another premium, farm bonds in random battles and events – you can buy a T8 premium
tank for 8,000 bonds (preferably Patriot/Chrysler).

Which premiums to buy? → Tierlist: [https://imgur.com/a/gqXYcog](https://imgur.com/a/gqXYcog)  
If you have a premium account for a limited time, focus on grinding credits with premium tanks.  
If you don’t have premium tanks, keep 1-2 Tier 6 tanks you enjoy (e.g., Cromwell, T-34-85) for credit farming.  
At higher tiers, you’ll lose credits even with a premium account (especially T10, which isn’t meant for earning
credits).  
You can mitigate losses by using standard ammo and playing without food or large consumables, but it’s less fun.

“What tank earns the most?” → Always the one you can deal the most damage with, but fun is also important – e.g., the
T34 has good alpha and pen, so you don’t spend much on ammo, but it’s not very fun to play.  
Check your depot and sell unnecessary items!  
Large consumables and food are best bought on sale, so save up credits in advance.

### Equipment

Table by Svitman, Ondra, and Gollder → [https://bit.ly/3nWLpFF](https://bit.ly/3nWLpFF)

Basic equipment for every turreted tank: Gun Rammer + Stabilizer.

- For turretless TDs: Gun Rammer, Ventilation/IRM/Optics/Gun Laying Drive (choose two of these four based on your
  preference).
- The third equipment is up to you – best options are Ventilation, Optics, Turbo, Improved Hardening.
- For autoloaders: Stabilizer, Optics, Hardening/Turbo/HP Boost.
- Pay attention to equipment slots – for mediums, use Turbo or Ventilation in the designated slot.
- For light tanks: Optics in the slot.
- For heavies: Hardening/Ventilation/Hardening.
- For TDs: Gun Rammer in the slot.

Bounty and trophy equipment does not receive slot bonuses, so their placement in slots doesn’t matter.

Don’t forget directives – if you have enough bonds, they can enhance your tank. The best directive is for the Gun
Rammer, followed by Ventilation.  
Check your depot; you might have many directives from past events.

Best bond equipment: Gun Rammer → Ventilation → Optics → Stabilizer.  
A few turreted tanks don’t need a Stabilizer, such as Super Conqueror, T-100 LT, LT-432, EBRs.

There are recommended equipment setups, but the final decision is always yours.

### Clan Gameplay

How to find a clan? → Forum, directly in battle/in the garage, Discord, streams, etc.

**Clan Benefits:** Community, clan reserves (credits + XP), platoons, Strongholds.  
Strongholds vs Advances: Strongholds for earning credits, Advances for coordination and reward chests.

What are reward chests for? They’re used to upgrade clan stronghold buildings, which unlock clan reserves for credits,
XP, etc.

A clan is not mandatory, but joining one can enhance your gaming experience and provide new insights.

### Tanks for Clan Gameplay

Tier 8 premium: Progetto, Bourrasque, LT-432, EBR, LIS.  
Tier 8 tech tree: Caernarvon, T-44, IS-3, T32, Tiger II.  
Tier 10 tech tree: EBR 105, CS-63, Object 140, Object 277, Conqueror Gun Carriage, Leopard 1, STB-1, Super Conqueror.  
Tier 10 reward: Object 279, Chieftain, Object 907.

Chieftain and Object 907 can be earned in clan campaigns held twice a year. To join a clan capable of earning these
tanks, you’ll need most of the Tier 10 tech tree tanks mentioned above.

### Personal Missions

Two sets of personal missions – one requiring nations (Obj. 279), the other requiring tank types (Obj. 260).  
Both sets provide good rewards for completing individual missions + reward tanks (notable ones: T55A, Chimera, Obj. 260,
Obj. 279).

They can be done without SPGs, but for the Obj. 260 set, you’ll need all the 15th missions with honors to skip SPG-15.
For the Obj. 279 set, you’ll need to complete all missions for all nation groups and skip stun missions.

You can also use SPGs to skip missions like blocking damage.

### Strategy

The key to success is knowing the positions on maps for each tank type and knowing what to do there – this requires
experience and time.  
At the start of each battle, read the tank lists of both teams and try to predict the strategy (see map videos).  
Don’t push a losing flank – if it’s lost, try to retreat (requires experience).  
If possible, aim for the front/rear wheels of enemy tanks to track them.

### Spotting Mechanics

Your tank’s view range counters enemy camo – camo differs while moving and standing still (3 seconds stationary = camo
reset).  
It’s worth having view range over 445m, as you can spot tanks at 400+ meters.  
**Proxy spotting:** Spotting an enemy within a 50m radius regardless of obstacles.

### Ammunition – Preload the next shell with a single keypress

- HE shells can break objects for better vision, finish low HP tanks (under 100 HP), and reset base caps. Beware, HE
  damage is not guaranteed and doesn’t penetrate obstacles.
- HEAT doesn’t lose penetration over distance but doesn’t penetrate obstacles and is slower.
- APCR is the fastest type, penetrates obstacles, but loses penetration over distance.
- AP has no special features other than better normalization than APCR (AP handles angled armor better than APCR with
  the same penetration).

**1v1 around cover** – Always force the opponent to back up; sometimes, it’s better to back off yourself to avoid proxy
spotting.

Always aim to be above opponents. If that’s not possible, get so low that they can’t lower their gun to hit you.  
Blind shots across the map are pointless; shells travel only about 720m.  
Repair fuel tanks (especially for RU/CN tanks) if you use food.  
Hold LMB to fire immediately upon reload.

### How to Track Improvement? Stats, etc.

Primarily aim to deal your tank’s HP in damage every battle.  
Winrate over 50% – the myth that WR can’t be influenced is false.  
WN8 – lab-vole.cz, wot-life.com – Ideally, aim for blue recent or better.

**For advanced players, good average damage benchmarks by tier (depends on tank class too):**

- **T8:** 2000+ average damage.
- **T9:** 2600+ average damage.
- **T10:** 3000+ average damage.

### Marking Tanks

**50% MoE:** The average combined damage (dealt + assisted) of all players on the server with that tank over the last 14
days.

- **65%:** One mark.
- **85%:** Two marks.
- **95%:** Three marks.

If you have three marks on a tank, you perform 45% better than the server average.  
Note: Assisted damage is split into tracking + spotting. Only the higher value is counted in a battle – e.g., 4500
dealt + 1500 spotted + 800 tracked = 6000 combined, not 6800.
