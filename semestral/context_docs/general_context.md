# World of Tanks Beginner's Guide: Efficient Progression Tips

This guide is designed to help new players and those with limited experience get the most out of their Credits, Gold,
and gameplay. It covers efficient tank progression, crew management, equipment, and resource usage. Experienced players
might already know these strategies, but for new players, this guide aims to clarify the essentials.

## Part 1: Tank Progression and Resource Management

### Avoid Selling Tanks Prematurely

- **Do not sell a tank until you’ve unlocked all subsequent tanks in its tech tree line.**
    - If the line splits, unlock both paths before moving on.
    - Prioritize researching modules that carry over to future tanks (e.g., engines shared between Heavy Tanks and Tank
      Destroyers).

### Selling Tanks Costs You

- When you sell a tank, you only recover 50% of the Credits spent on it, including its modules, ammo, and consumables.
- If you later decide to revisit a line, you’ll need to repurchase the tank and its upgrades, wasting more Credits in
  the long run.
- Instead of selling tanks, keep them in your garage as placeholders until you’re certain you won’t revisit the line.

### Retain Ammo and Consumables

- Keep any leftover ammo and consumables when selling a tank.
    - Ammo is cheap and often compatible with other tanks.
    - Consumables (repair kits, medkits, food) are universally useful and save you money in the future.

## Part 2: Crew Management

### Your Crew is Everything

- A well-trained crew is essential for your tank’s performance. Crew skills affect accuracy, reload speed, traverse, and
  more.
- When selling a tank, **always retain the crew** and retrain them for the next tank in the line.
    - Use Credits to retrain them to at least 75%, especially for tanks Tier 5 and above.

### Specialization and Longevity

- Maintain a dedicated crew for each tank line.
    - Move your existing crew to the next tank as you progress.
- While 5+ skills per crew member are ideal, focus on **Brothers in Arms** and either **Repairs** or **Camouflage** for
  practical performance.

## Part 3: Boosters and Grinding

### Use Boosters Strategically

- XP and Credit boosters are invaluable for speeding up progression.
- **Activate a 1-hour XP booster** at the start of your session and prioritize the tanks you struggle with most for
  their daily x2 bonus.

### Efficient Grinding

- Completing daily first-win bonuses across multiple tanks ensures steady progress.
- Always balance grinding with your Credit reserves to avoid bottlenecks when unlocking higher-tier tanks.

## Part 4: Premium Purchases

### Spending Gold Wisely

- For Free-to-Play players, the grind is manageable but slower.
    - If you choose to spend money, invest in a **good Tier 8 Premium Heavy Tank**.
    - Premium tanks have built-in Credit boosters, making them ideal for farming.

### Premium Time

- While Premium time accelerates progression, it’s often obtainable through events.
- Focus on earning event rewards or completing marathons for free Premium tanks and bonuses.

## Part 5: Equipment

### When to Start Using Equipment

- Avoid investing in equipment until Tier 6 or higher, where it makes a more noticeable impact.
- Use Gold to unequip valuable equipment for reuse on other tanks.
    - Spending a small amount of Gold saves hundreds of thousands of Credits in the long run.

### Compatibility Matters

- Equipment isn’t always transferable to higher-tier tanks. However, unused items can often enhance other vehicles in
  your garage.

## Part 6: Blueprint Usage

### Use Blueprints Wisely

- Save Blueprints for higher tiers, especially tanks known for poor performance or requiring significant XP.
    - Examples: Use Blueprints to skip tanks like the **TVP VTU** or **AMX 65 t**, not lower-tier tanks like the *
      *Matilda**.

### Avoid Impulsive Decisions

- Plan your tech tree progression carefully to maximize the value of Blueprints. Wasting them on low-tier tanks can
  leave you struggling later.

## Final Tips

### Frugality and Planning

- Be cautious with your Credits and Gold. Avoid unnecessary purchases or upgrades.
- Long-term waste adds up, potentially delaying your ability to afford high-tier tanks like the **T-10**.

### Enjoy the Journey

- Progressing efficiently is important, but don’t forget to have fun and experiment with different tank lines to find
  your preferred playstyle.

By following these tips, you’ll maximize your resources and enjoy a smoother experience in World of Tanks. Good luck on
the battlefield!
