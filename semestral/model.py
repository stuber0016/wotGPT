model.py - World of Tanks AI Assistant Module

This module implements an AI-powered assistant for World of Tanks players. It provides functionality to:
1. Process general queries about World of Tanks
2. Connect to the Wargaming (WG) API to retrieve real-time player data
3. Analyze player statistics and provide personalized improvement tips

The module interacts directly with Wargaming's servers, fetching up-to-date player statistics and information.
This live data retrieval ensures that the AI assistant's analysis and recommendations are based on the most current player performance.

Key components:
- Model class: Handles player queries, data retrieval, and AI interactions
- ChatGroq integration: Uses the Groq API for natural language processing
- WG API integration: Connects to Wargaming servers for real-time player data
- Player data caching: Stores player IDs and data to minimize API calls
- Context management: Maintains conversation context for each user

The module uses environment variables for API endpoints and keys, and implements
methods for player lookup, live data retrieval from WG servers, and query processing.

Dependencies:
- os: For environment variable access
- dotenv: For loading environment variables
- langchain_groq: For ChatGroq integration
- langchain_core.messages: For message handling in AI conversations
- requests: For making HTTP requests to the Wargaming API
- rag_read: Custom module for reading RAG context
